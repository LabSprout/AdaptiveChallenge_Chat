# AdaptiveChallenge

**AdaptiveChallenge** is a challenge of writing an adaptive codes.

You must write a code available to others to make an addition implemention.

Also, you will make an implemention on other's code.

You will experience

- writing a readble, adaptive code
- and code reviewing,

and learn

- what is like to use other's code.

## RULES

1. **On Board**  
   Game Master will provides the challengers :

   - System requirements
   - test cases

   Clarifying questions to game master is allowed.  
   The clarification will be open to everybody.

   Challengers forks this repository to develop.  
   The task will be shown at `Docs/Requirements`
   If having questions to game master, make an issue on original(this) repository.

2. **Implemention**  
   Challengers implement a codes until the **3. Code Review**.  
   **Implement on `dev_base` branch** and **DON'T merge to `main` branch**.

   Challengers are free to write/draw documents to make their codes more readable.

3. **Code Review**  
   Challengers will be the other challenger's **modifer**s.  
   Challengers will know who will be their modifers in this time.

   Make a `dev_base` -> `main` pull-request, and **Modifers** will make a **code review** on their base-coders.  
   Base-coders must make an improvement according to their modifers review.  
   This will be repeated until modifers approve.

   Modifers must make the base-code clear to them, because they will implement on it at **4**

4. **Addition Implemention**  
   Game Master will show a **addition implemention task** after code reviewing.

   **Modifers** must implement the task **on their base-coder's code**, not modifer's base-code.

   Don't copy&paste from your base-code.

5. **Blaming**  
   After 4, modifers will make a blame

   - What they suffered on adding improvements
   - What they couldn't understand about their base-codes.

   But must not deny their base-coder's personality.  
   Blame **only on their code + documentaion**, with respect.
